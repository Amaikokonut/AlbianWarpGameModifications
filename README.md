# About

This (is intended to eventually be) a repurposed fork of the AlbianWarpGameModifications intended-- not for use with Albian Warp, but for local ant-farm-style linking together of multiple instances of DS running at the same time.

## Installation

This set of scripts is intended for and developed to function in Linux with the [dstation-2020](https://github.com/Nazushvel/dstation-2020/) install script. With this in mind, the majority of the files should go into the mods directory that dstation2020 provides. But since none of this works yet, we'll be figuring out the specifics later.

## Usage

None of this works at all yet, so this will be updated later.
